# 🚗 Autonomous Car Detection

Car detection project for autonomous driving using deep learning and computer vision. This project uses a pre-trained YOLO object detection model with OpenCV to identify vehicles in real-time from road images or video frames.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to apply object detection techniques for autonomous driving applications, specifically **car detection**. It uses:

- ✅ **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** deep learning model for object detection
- ✅ **OpenCV** for image and video processing
- ✅ **Python** for implementation in Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Deep learning-based object detection (YOLO)
- Image preprocessing and annotation
- Real-time bounding box drawing
- Confidence thresholding
- Intersection Over Union (IoU) visualization

---

## 📁 Files

- `Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the implementation.
- `images/`: Directory for input road images.
- `yolo/`: Contains YOLO model files (`.cfg`, `.weights`, and `.names`).
